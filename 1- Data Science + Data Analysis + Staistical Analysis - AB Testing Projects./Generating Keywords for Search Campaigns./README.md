**Project Description**
Automatically generate keywords for a search engine marketing campaign using Python to send website visitors to the right landing page.

When structuring a search engine marketing account, a key task is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages.

In this project, you'll practice how to automatically generate keywords for a search engine marketing campaign using Python to send website visitors to the right landing page.

Save at least 60 unique keywords as a DataFrame called keywords_df and a CSV file called keywords.csv.
Both of these should contain four columns:
Ad Group: containing the product names
Keyword: containing the product and keyword combinations, combined in both directions (word + product, and product + word)
Campaign: with the value SEM_Sofas in every row
Criterion Type: with the value Exact in every row.
