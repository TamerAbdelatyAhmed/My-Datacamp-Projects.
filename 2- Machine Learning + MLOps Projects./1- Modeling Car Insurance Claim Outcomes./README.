Project Description
Machine learning is very popular in the insurance market, which has long been renowned for being data-driven.

Working on behalf of On the Road car insurance, I investigated their customer data to identify the feature that produces the most accurate logistic regression model 
for them to predict whether a claim will be made against a policy!
