Project Description:
Machine learning is very popular in the insurance market, which has long been renowned for being data-driven. Working on behalf of On the Road car insurance, I 
investigated their customer data to identify the feature that produces the most accurate logistic regression model for them to predict whether a claim will 
be made against a policy!

Insurance companies invest a lot of time and money into optimizing their pricing and accurately estimating the likelihood that customers will make a claim. In many 
countries insurance it is a legal requirement to have car insurance in order to drive a vehicle on public roads, so the market is very large!

Knowing all of this, On the Road car insurance have requested your services in building a model to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their insurance 
during the policy period. As they have very little expertise and infrastructure for deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they've asked you to identify 
the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy, so they can start with a simple model in production.

They have supplied you with their customer data as a csv file called car_insurance.csv, along with a table detailing the column names and descriptions below.
